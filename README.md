# NasaWorldWindProject
A Java-based application using the NASA WorldWind SDK for 3D geospatial visualization. This project enables interactive exploration of Earth with custom layers, real-time data rendering, and user interaction features for enhanced geospatial analysis from both live JSONs and JSON files. Developed as part of a job interview process, this project also helped me refresh and sharpen my skills in Java Swing and the overall software development process.
